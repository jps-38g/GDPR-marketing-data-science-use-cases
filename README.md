Paper illustrating an approach to determine if the use of personal data for specific data science projects (within the marketing domain) can be conducted in compliance with GDPR

# An Evaluation of Data Science Use Cases and their Adherence to GDPR Guidelines

## Overview
This repository contains a paper exploring how data science teams can evaluate the legitimate use of personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for marketing domain use cases. While GDPR provides a strong legal framework, it offers limited practical guidance for real-world analytical workflows. This paper addresses that gap by demonstrating how the Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA) test can be applied to common data science scenarios.

## Paper Summary
The paper provides:
1. A high-level overview of GDPR and its relevance to data science.
2. A clear explanation of the Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA) test.
3. Scenario-based evaluations applying the LIA to marketing data science use cases.
4. A quick comparison of GDPR-aligned practices with U.S. privacy guidelines for the same use cases.
5. Recommendations for improving the efficiency and consistency of LIA-driven workflows.

## Why This Matters
Data science teams frequently work with personal data but often lack concrete examples of how to evaluate compliance obligations. This paper offers a structured, scenario-driven approach that helps practitioners:
- Identify lawful bases for processing  
- Assess risks and mitigations  
- Document decisions transparently  
- Align analytical work with privacy-by-design principles
