# Executive Summary

Data science teams frequently encounter projects involving personal data from European Union (EU) citizens, yet practical guidance for evaluating GDPR compliance remains limited. 

This paper provides a structured, scenario-driven approach to determining whether data science use cases can be conducted lawfully under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The paper begins with a high-level overview of GDPR, emphasizing its role as a principles-based framework rather than a prescriptive rulebook. 

It then introduces the Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA) test, a three-part evaluation recommended for determining whether personal data processing can be justified under the “legitimate interests” legal basis.

To bridge the gap between regulation and practice, the paper applies the LIA framework to several marketing-oriented data science scenarios. 

These examples illustrate how organizations can balance business objectives with data subject rights, assess risks, and decide on the best path forward.

The paper also provides a high-level comparison of how similar use cases would be evaluated under U.S. privacy guidelines, highlighting key differences in regulatory philosophy and enforcement.

Finally, the paper offers recommendations for improving the efficiency of the compliant implementation and conducting LIAs for the marketing use cases.
